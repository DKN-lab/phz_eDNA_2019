# Abstract

---

Extracellular electron transfer (EET), the process whereby cells access electron acceptors or donors that reside many cell lengths away, enables metabolic activity by microorganisms, particularly under oxidant-limited conditions that occur in multicellular bacterial biofilms. Although different mechanisms underpin this process in select organisms, a widespread strategy involves extracellular electron shuttles, redox-active metabolites that are secreted and recycled by diverse bacteria. How these shuttles catalyze electron transfer within biofilms without being lost to the environment has been a long-standing question. Here, we show that phenazine electron shuttles mediate efficient EET through interactions with extracellular DNA (eDNA) in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* biofilms, which are important in nature and disease. Retention of pyocyanin (PYO) and phenazine carboxamide in the biofilm matrix is facilitated by binding to eDNA. In vitro, different phenazines can exchange electrons in the presence or absence of DNA and phenazines can participate directly in redox reactions through DNA; the biofilm eDNA can also support rapid ET between intercalators. Electrochemical measurements of biofilms indicate that retained PYO supports an efficient redox cycle with rapid EET and slow loss from the biofilm. Together, these results establish that eDNA plays a previously unrecognized role facilitating phenazine metabolic processes in P. aeruginosa biofilms, suggesting a model for how extracellular electron shuttles achieve retention and efficient EET in biofilms.

## 1

### *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and phenazines {.toc-ignore}

*Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is a bacterium that makes special redox active metabolites (electron carriers), called phenazines. These phenazines come in a few different forms that are shown below (PCA, PCN, PYO). This organism tends to live as "biofilms", dense groups of cells attached to surfaces. These structures are so dense that the cells on the outside of the biofilm consume oxygen faster than it can diffuse to the inside of the group. These cells respire oxygen (use as a terminal electron acceptor), just like animals do, so the cells in the interior of the biofilm could suffocate without oxygen. However, these interior cells are able to actually use their phenazine molecules to transport electrons to the oxygen at the edge of the biofilm. This is an amazing strategy, but many aspects of this phenazine metabolism remain poorly understood. Specifically, we set out to answer X, Y, Z.

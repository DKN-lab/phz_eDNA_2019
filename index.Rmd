# Abstract

---

Extracellular electron transfer (EET), the process whereby cells access electron acceptors or donors that reside many cell lengths away, enables metabolic activity by microorganisms, particularly under oxidant-limited conditions that occur in multicellular bacterial biofilms. Although different mechanisms underpin this process in select organisms, a widespread strategy involves extracellular electron shuttles, redox-active metabolites that are secreted and recycled by diverse bacteria. How these shuttles catalyze electron transfer within biofilms without being lost to the environment has been a long-standing question. Here, we show that phenazine electron shuttles mediate efficient EET through interactions with extracellular DNA (eDNA) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, which are important in nature and disease. Retention of pyocyanin (PYO) and phenazine carboxamide in the biofilm matrix is facilitated by binding to eDNA. In vitro, different phenazines can exchange electrons in the presence or absence of DNA and phenazines can participate directly in redox reactions through DNA; the biofilm eDNA can also support rapid ET between intercalators. Electrochemical measurements of biofilms indicate that retained PYO supports an efficient redox cycle with rapid EET and slow loss from the biofilm. Together, these results establish that eDNA plays a previously unrecognized role facilitating phenazine metabolic processes in P. aeruginosa biofilms, suggesting a model for how extracellular electron shuttles achieve retention and efficient EET in biofilms.

We have found a few things merp derp:

## 1

Put simple explanatory figures here with short narratives. E.g. the phenazine biofilm cycle or other illustrator generated diagrams.

Colony biofilms retain certain phenazines. Some more text here. Test
